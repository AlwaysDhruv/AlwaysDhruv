- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AlwaysDhruv
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning So Mnay IT Subjects...
- i have Expicite Knowledge Of Programming Base And Languages Like C\C++,Python,Sql etc...
- My Most Favoraite Language And 2nd level Of Knowledge in C++.


My Suggetion According My Experiance in IT Field "Understand The Think":- 

1.Peocedure Oriented Programming :- The Most Required and or Saying Other Word is That Without Base Knowledge
                                    Programming are very citicals maded in our mind so for base knowledge  is  
                                    equ valent to Peocedure Oriented Programming. 

                                    That base comes from The God Of Our Programming C Language.

                                    This Language are Most widly used programming language for base programming\
                                    Peocedure Oriented Programming.  

                                    So First Of All Made Base in Your Mind.
                                    
2.Object Oriented Technology     :- The Most Used And Using All Time Requied Is That Object Oriented Technology
                                    Evry Language Have Object Oriented Technology Which Are The Work On Object.
                                    The Pure Object Oriented Language The Is That Java.

                                    Jave is The one most famous and all rouderd language that are used   make 
                                    software,websites,windows form application,ios based aaplication, andriod
                                    based appication etc... that language will handeled.

                                    My Favoraite Language Is the C++.
                                    
3.Software Engeeneering          :- The complicated sibject is the software engineering because software communic-
                                    ate with user and develope the user friendly environment there most complicated
                                    task we hadeled in software engineering.

                                    Software have two ends First Of all Frontend And Second Is The Backend.

                                    1.Frontend :- frontend means make user friendl environment with user this is the task of frontend.

                                      Most Usable Languages :- C++,Javascript,rubby,python...
                                    
                                    2.Backend  :- backend means user give any tyoe of data to store system memory this
                                                  task is the task backend.

                                      Most Usable Languages :- Sql,MySql,sqlite....
4.Data Structure And Algorithms   :-
